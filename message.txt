Everything else like the mancave section will still be free. Paying for this service your live tv will never go down![COLORred][COLORdeepskyblue][/B] [COLORlime] [COLORyellow] [COLORred][COLORgreen][COLORpurple][COLORred] [COLORdeepskyblue] [COLORwhite] [COLORorange][COLORlime] Contact: [B][COLORlime]--[COLORwhite]snelltv82@gmail.com [COLORred] for user name and password![COLORdeepskyblue] If you did not get a box or firestick from me or Anthony Dixon the user name and password will be $5 a month. [COLORlime]In order for the arcade to work you must install the emulators or emulator of your choice in the arcade section and then download the rom of your choice and enjoy. If you have a android box you can use an xbox 360 controller or a ps4 and firestick must use a bluetooth controller! [COLORfuchsia]paypal.me/edwardlamar[/B][/COLOR]|||
