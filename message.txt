All the channels have been paid for by me. I do not charge for anything except the live tv, the equipment and my time Everything else like the mancave section will still be free. Paying for this service your live tv will never go down![COLORred][COLORdeepskyblue][/B] [COLORlime] [COLORyellow] [COLORred][COLORgreen][COLORpurple][COLORred] [COLORdeepskyblue] [COLORwhite] [COLORorange][B]TEST TRIALS ARE AVALIBLE AFTER YOU UPDATE TO THE LASTEST BUILD[COLORlime] Contact: [B][COLORlime]--[COLORwhite]snelltv82@gmail.com [COLORred] for user name and password![COLORdeepskyblue] If you did not get a box or firestick from me or Anthony Dixon the user name and password will be $15.
